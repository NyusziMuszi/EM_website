This is my personal site, right now coming in a minimal flavour.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Start the server:
   `npm start`
3. Open:
   `http://localhost:3000`

Portfolio content is stored in SQLite (`db/portfolio.sqlite`) and seeded from
`db/seed-data.js` when the database is empty.
